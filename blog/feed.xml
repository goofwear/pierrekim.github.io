        <title>Small monitoring system using Freemobile</title>
        <link href="2015-06-23-small-monitoring-system-using-freemobile.html"/>
        <content type="html"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>In order to help a friend to monitor his webservices, I have written a small tool to check the availability of the different webservices.</p>
<p>The script is used with crontab and the <a href="https://mobile.free.fr/">Freemobile API</a> provides the possibility to send free SMS (free as a free beer). You can choose if you prefer SMS alerts, email alerts or both.
It checks the HTTP return code of the webpages : anything other than 200 will trigger the alert.</p>
<p>You have to edit:
  - ALERT_SMS_API
  - ALERT_EMAIL
  - LOGFILE
  - use_sms=y (by default, yes)
  - use_email=y (by default, yes)</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# apt-get install screen curl mailutils

URL=$1

ALERT_SMS_API="https://smsapi.free-mobile.fr/sendmsg?user=USERID_FIXME&amp;pass=PASSWORD_FIXME&amp;msg="
ALERT_EMAIL="email@email0.com_FIXME email@email1.com_FIXME"
LOGFILE=/home/availability/alert.log

use_sms=y
use_email=y


umask 077

if [ ! $1 ]; then
  echo "usage $0 http://www.url.to/test"
  exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "${LOGFILE}" ]; then
  touch "${LOGFILE}"
fi



alert() {
  current_date=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%m:%S")
  msg="${current_date} - ALERT on $1"

  echo "${msg} - alert()" &gt;&gt; ${LOGFILE}

  if [ ${use_sms} = "y" ]; then
    curl -sL -o /dev/null --insecure "${ALERT_SMS_API}${msg}"
    echo "${msg} - sms sent" &gt;&gt; ${LOGFILE}
  fi

  if [ ${use_email} = "y" ]; then
    for j in ${ALERT_EMAIL}
    do
      echo "${msg}" | mail -s "${msg}" ${j}
      echo "${msg} - email sent to ${j}" &gt;&gt; ${LOGFILE}
    done
  fi
}


curl 2&gt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null
if [ $? -ne 2 ]; then
  alert "curl not found"
  exit
fi

output=$(curl -sL -w "%{http_code}\n" "$1" -o /dev/null --connect-timeout 5)

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  alert ${URL}
  exit
fi

if [ "X${output}" != "X200" ]; then
  alert ${URL}
  exit
fi
</code></pre>
<p>The crontabs to check the webservices every 5 minutes are:</p>
<pre><code>*/5   *    *    *    *    /home/availability/alert-availability.sh http://domain.com/path/to/webservice0
*/5   *    *    *    *    /home/availability/alert-availability.sh http://domain.com/path/to/webservice1
*/5   *    *    *    *    /home/availability/alert-availability.sh http://domain.com/path/to/webservice2
*/5   *    *    *    *    /home/availability/alert-availability.sh http://domain.com/path/to/webservice3
</code></pre>
<p>This tool was tested on a Debian 7.6. So you need perhaps to run apt to install the necessary packages:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install curl mailutils
</code></pre>
<p>You can see the past alerts as entries in the logfile:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-01 13:10:02 - ALERT on http://www.XXX.XXX/status/XXXX - alert()
2015-05-01 13:10:02 - ALERT on http://www.XXX.XXX/status/XXXX - sms sent
2015-05-01 13:10:02 - ALERT on http://www.XXX.XXX/status/XXXX - email sent to email@email0.com_FIXME
2015-05-01 13:10:02 - ALERT on http://www.XXX.XXX/status/XXXX - email sent to email@email1.com_FIXME

        <title>Recovering Windows on a "Windows-free" LG laptop</title>
        <link href="2015-06-09-recovering-windows-on-a-windows-free-lg-laptop.html"/>
        <content type="html"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just bought a new laptop, a <a href="http://search.daum.net/search?q=LG+13ZD950">LG 13ZD950</a>. This laptop can be purchased without Windows in South Korea (like a lot of new laptops in South Korea).</p>
<p>The "Windows-free" version doesn't boot on a system by default: you have to install your own OS.</p>
<p>Before installing Linux, I analyzed the internal SSD: even if the laptop is "Windows-free", Windows seems to be present but the laptop doesn't boot.</p>
<p>By default, you can only see a 10GB NTFS partition (/dev/sda1) called "DnA" containing 3GB of Windows drivers.</p>
<p>I will explain now how to recover a full Windows 8.1 factory copy available in the SSD.</p>
<p><strong>The laptop is brand new. According to S.M.A.R.T, the SSD is new too.</strong></p>
<p>Boot with <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a> then use <strong>testdisk</strong> (from <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/">photorec</a>):</p>
<pre><code>kali% sudo testdisk /dev/sda
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="images/lg-windows-testdisk-001.png" /></p>
<p>Use Intel/PC partition and Analyse the hard disk:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/lg-windows-testdisk-002.png" /></p>
<p>You will see the 10GB NTFS partition, called "DnA" containing 3GB of Windows drivers.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/lg-windows-testdisk-003.png" /></p>
<p>The Quick Search option discovered 2 new partitions:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/lg-windows-testdisk-004.png" /></p>
<p>The "Windows" partition contains a fully bootable Windows 8.1 system.</p>
<p>The "ICPE" partition is a rescue partition allowing the reinstallation of Windows 8.1 from scratch.</p>
<p>Now confirm the Windows partition as a bootable partition:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/lg-windows-testdisk-005.png" /></p>
<p>Reboot now!</p>
<p>The Windows initialization system will ask the user name, the computer name and the default preferred color. After this, you have now a fully working Windows 8.1 system with a "Windows-free" LG laptop. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Hello Windows 8.1:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/lg-windows-8.1.png" /></p></content>

 ## Advisory Information

 Title: 112 ipTIME Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls models vulnerable with RCE with root privileges
 Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/2015-iptime-0x00.txt.asc
 Date published: 2015-04-17
 Vendors contacted: KrCERT, ipTIME
 Release mode: Released
 CVE: no current CVE



 ## Product Description

 EFMNetworks ipTIME is the largest Korean brand of SOHO/small/middle entreprise Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls in South Korea
 with millions of devices deployed in the country. EFMNetworks ipTIME is occupying more than 60 percent of personal network devices.
 There are =~ 10 000 000 of ipTIME devices deployed in South Korea.



 ## Vulnerability Summary

 This vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and to get a direct RCE as root from the LAN side with a single HTTP request.

 This is a direct RCE against the Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls which gives a complete root access to the embedded Linux from the LAN side.
 The exploit doesn't work by default from the WAN (no HTTP or UPNP access from the WAN by default unless activated).
 If enabled on the WAN, the remote admin interface exposes the devices to this vulnerability.

 It affects 112 ipTIME products from 2009-era firmwares to the 9.52 firmware (built time 2015-03-23)) with the default configuration:

 Concerning the high CVSS score (10/10) of the vulnerability, the number of affected devices and the longevity of this vulnerability (6+ year old), we urge users to apply the new 9.58 firmware.



 ## Details

 The HTTP server allows the attacker to execute some CGI files.

 Many of them are vulnerable to a command inclusion which allows to execute commands with the http daemon user rights (root).

## Advisory Information

Title: FreeBSD 10.x ZFS encryption.key disclosure (CVE-2015-1415)
Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/CVE-2015-1415.txt.asc
Date published: 2015-04-07
Vendors contacted: FreeBSD
Release mode: Coordinated release



## Product Description

FreeBSD is a UNIX-like operating system.



## Vulnerability Summary

FreeBSD 10.x installer supports the installation of FreeBSD 10.x  on  an
encrypted ZFS filesystem by default.

When using the encryption system within ZFS during the  installation  of
FreeBSD 10.0 and FreeBSD 10.1, the encryption.key has wrong  permissions
which allow local users to read this file.

Even if the keyfile is passphrase-encrypted, it can present a risk.



## Details

By default, the encryption key file is /boot/encryption.key.

Instead of being 0600, the permissions are 0644:

$ ls -la /boot/encryption.key
- -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  4096 Feb 17 15:16 /boot/encryption.key
$

This file is readable by a local user.



## Vendor Response

According to the vendor, a security advisory will be published, describing
the problem and the solution. It concerns:

    - stable/10, 10.1-STABLE
    - releng/10.1, 10.1-RELEASE-p8
    - releng/10.0, 10.0-RELEASE-p18


## Report Timeline

 * Mar 01, 2015: Problem found by Pierre Kim
 * Apr 01, 2015: Vendor is notified of the vulnerability
 * Apr 01, 2015: Vendor confirms report and indicates a fix is  prepared
