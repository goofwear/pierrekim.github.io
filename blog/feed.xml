 ## Advisory Information

 Title: 112 ipTIME Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls models vulnerable with RCE with root privileges
 Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/2015-iptime-0x00.txt.asc
 Date published: 2015-04-17
 Vendors contacted: KrCERT, ipTIME
 Release mode: Released
 CVE: no current CVE



 ## Product Description

 EFMNetworks ipTIME is the largest Korean brand of SOHO/small/middle entreprise Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls in South Korea
 with millions of devices deployed in the country. EFMNetworks ipTIME is occupying more than 60 percent of personal network devices.
 There are =~ 10 000 000 of ipTIME devices deployed in South Korea.



 ## Vulnerability Summary

 This vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and to get a direct RCE as root from the LAN side with a single HTTP request.

 This is a direct RCE against the Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls which gives a complete root access to the embedded Linux from the LAN side.
 The exploit doesn't work by default from the WAN (no HTTP or UPNP access from the WAN by default unless activated).
 If enabled on the WAN, the remote admin interface exposes the devices to this vulnerability.

 It affects 112 ipTIME products from 2009-era firmwares to the 9.52 firmware (built time 2015-03-23)) with the default configuration:

 ## Details

 The HTTP server allows the attacker to execute some CGI files.

 Many of them are vulnerable to a command inclusion which allows to execute commands with the http daemon user rights (root).

 Considering the huge potential impact against the South Korea networks, we are not currently planning to release working exploits.



 The exploits will be posted on my blog located at https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/


 ## Vendor Response

 The vendor has released a new firmware version (9.58) for 112 devices:

## Advisory Information

Title: FreeBSD 10.x ZFS encryption.key disclosure (CVE-2015-1415)
Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/CVE-2015-1415.txt.asc
Date published: 2015-04-07
Vendors contacted: FreeBSD
Release mode: Coordinated release



## Product Description

FreeBSD is a UNIX-like operating system.



## Vulnerability Summary

FreeBSD 10.x installer supports the installation of FreeBSD 10.x  on  an
encrypted ZFS filesystem by default.

When using the encryption system within ZFS during the  installation  of
FreeBSD 10.0 and FreeBSD 10.1, the encryption.key has wrong  permissions
which allow local users to read this file.

Even if the keyfile is passphrase-encrypted, it can present a risk.



## Details

By default, the encryption key file is /boot/encryption.key.

Instead of being 0600, the permissions are 0644:

$ ls -la /boot/encryption.key
- -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  4096 Feb 17 15:16 /boot/encryption.key
$

This file is readable by a local user.



## Vendor Response

According to the vendor, a security advisory will be published, describing
the problem and the solution. It concerns:

    - stable/10, 10.1-STABLE
    - releng/10.1, 10.1-RELEASE-p8
    - releng/10.0, 10.0-RELEASE-p18


## Report Timeline

 * Mar 01, 2015: Problem found by Pierre Kim
 * Apr 01, 2015: Vendor is notified of the vulnerability
 * Apr 01, 2015: Vendor confirms report and indicates a fix is  prepared
   but there will be no security advisory format notification because of
   the nature of the problem
 * Apr 02, 2015: Pierre Kim asks a CVE number to the vendor
 * Apr 02, 2015: Vendor indicates to use CVE-2015-1415  and  confirms that a
   signed notification to the mailing lists will be sent.
 * Apr 03, 2015: Pierre Kim contacts FreeBSD about the future notification
 * Apr 04, 2015: Vendor confirms a security advisory will be published
   next week
 * Apr 07, 2015: Vendor publishes a security advisory (FreeBSD-SA-15:08)
 * Apt 07, 2015: This advisory is sent to bugtraq@
